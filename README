This is a Rotary-Dial-to-USB-Interface, based on the USB AVR Lab
(http://www.ullihome.de/wiki/USBAVRLab/index). For schematics,
see http://www.ullihome.de/wiki/USBAVRLab/Download

This is a tiny board with an ATMEGA8 speaking USB using the V-USB
library. It features a 10-pin-port with some AVR pins routed out,
and also has a bootloader, so it can be programmed without an
ISP adapter, using USB.


The Rotary-Dial-to-USB-Interface expects a rotary dial to be attached against PB4/5.
When you look at the front of the connector:
 ____   ____
| 9 7 . . . |  Attach the two cables for the idle switch at 9 and 0.
| 0 8 . . . |  Attach the two cables for the dial pulse switch at 7 and 8.
 -----------   (0 and 8 are routed to GND, 9 and 7 to PB4 and PB5.)

The program expects the "idle"-switch to be open when the dial is idle, and to be closed
when the rotary dial is not in its idle position.
The "pulse" switch is expected to be closed most of the time, and to be only opened shortly
for each pulse.
(This can be adapted easily).

When attached to a computer, the device acts like a USB HID keyboard, no
additional drivers are needed.


If you want to enter the bootloader, then generate more than 17 dial pulses by
dialing a zero, not letting the dial return fully into idle position yet,
and pulling it to zero again.
